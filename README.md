This is POSF's official application portal for hosting open‑source projects.

We're backed by our parent organization, [Pyro](https://pyro.host), and our mission is to provide free, reliable, and secure hosting for open‑source projects.

## 🚧 Important Notice

> **Please note:** POSF is currently in early alpha. Initial onboarding may take longer than the 7 business days stated below. Thank you for your patience!

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Prepare**  
   - Your project must use an [OSI‑approved license](https://opensource.org/licenses).  
   - The primary code repository must be public and active.

2. **Apply**  
   - Click **[New Issue](../../issues/new?template=posf_hosting_application.yml)**.  
   - Choose the **“POSF Hosting Application”** template.  
   - Fill in the requested details:  
     - Architecture diagram (optional but helpful)  
     - Estimated resource usage (CPU, RAM, storage, bandwidth)  
     - Security requirements (TLS, data residency, backups)  
     - Service‑level expectations (uptime, incident response, etc.)  

3. **Review & Onboarding**  
   - The POSF Infrastructure Team will triage your request within **7 business days**.  
   - We’ll contact you by email for any clarifications or next steps.  
   - Once approved, you’ll receive access credentials and onboarding documentation.

> **Heads up:** An application does **not** guarantee acceptance. Approval depends on resource availability, project maturity, and community impact.
